  Key Findings

  âœ… What's Working Well

  - Strong content structure and information flow
  - Proper accessibility with semantic HTML and keyboard navigation
  - Responsive layout across all viewports
  - Strategic CTA placement throughout the page
  - No technical errors or console warnings

  ðŸ”´ High-Priority Issues

  1. Visual Design Gap: The current implementation lacks the sophisticated, traditional aesthetic specified in your design principles - missing the
  Notre Dame-inspired elegance, refined typography (Playfair Display), and distinctive color palette (Deep Navy #2c3e50, Warm Gold #d4af37).
  2. Missing Brand Elements: No geometric background patterns, section treatments, or architectural visual elements that should differentiate Piano
  Depot from generic websites.
  3. Navigation Functionality: Dropdown menus may not be working properly - the "About Us" menu showed an active state but no dropdown appeared
  during testing.
  4. Typography & Color Implementation: Using basic system fonts instead of the specified serif/sans-serif combination, and not utilizing the
  carefully defined brand color palette.

  ðŸ“‹ Priority Recommendations

  Immediate (Pre-Launch):
  - Implement Playfair Display typography
  - Apply Deep Navy/Warm Gold/Cream color scheme
  - Fix navigation dropdowns
  - Style CTAs per brand guidelines

  Short-term:
  - Add warm gold geometric patterns
  - Enhance service cards with sophisticated iconography
  - Implement navy/cream section backgrounds
  - Refine hover states and transitions

  The homepage has solid content and functionality, but needs visual refinement to match the sophisticated brand positioning outlined in your design
   principles.
