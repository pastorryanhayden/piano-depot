I need to change the way that the piano inventory works.  Specifically, we need to organize the pianos under these categories:
- Disklavier Pianos
- Acoustic Grand Pianos
- Silent & Trans Acoustic Pianos
- Acoustic Upright Pianos
- Clavinova and Hybrid Pianos
- Portable Digital Pianos
- Used & Refurbished Pianos

Now, here is the change.  The client this is for is a Yamaha dealer, and they are not allowed to share prices for new pianos on their website.  So the product pages for everything except the Used and Refurbished needs to be more of an informational page with no price, the used items will have prices and what we have now can work.  
We need to update the admin panel to reflect these changes.
